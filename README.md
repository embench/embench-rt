# Embench Real Time Benchmarks

Micro-benchmark for embedded systems to characterize their behavior in respect
of context switching speed and interrupt latency.

This repository was previously known as `embench-context-latency`.

This work was initiated by Cesare Garlati (@cgarlati) and is now led by Ofer
Shinaar (@oferShinaar) and Ronen Haen (@rhwd)
